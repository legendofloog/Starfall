//Scene setting: Esme, Solomin, and Alastore reach the outskirts of Yulian territory, coming across a southern outpost built around a rural village; esme initially off screen


## C5BeginningScene1
[MidLeft][LoadAlastore]
[MidRight][LoadSolomin][3LB]
Despite some setbacks, we've finally[N]
arrived in Yulian territory[Beat] Well,[N]
if those blazing red flags speak true.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm, the unmistakable sign of their[N]
army. Somnville is the first town[N]
outside of the Zarest-Yulian border,[AN]
so it's of no surprise that Duke[N]
Yulian keeps this outpost well-manned.[AN]
[MidRight]
A wise lord, then. I'd not trust[N]
a neighboring house's sweet words,[N]
not without an army at my back.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Loathe as I am to admit it, Hedera's[N]
history of conflict between the[N]
noble houses reinforces that notion.[AN]
Before the fall, we knew peace, but[Beat][AN][X]

//Esme walks up

## C5BeginningScene2
[FarLeft][LoadAlastore]
[Left][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight][LoadEsme]
House Yulian discarded it, and this[N]
town will see bloodshed once more.[AN]
The leader of their forces rejected[N]
our parley, so we have no choice now.[A]
[Left]
Blasted fool[Beat] He'd sacrifice his men[N]
in the face of an unwinnable fight?[A]
[MidRight]
His men, and Somnville's civilians.[N]
Based on reports from our scouts,[AN]
the citizenry have taken up arms,[N]
doubtless with a lance behind them.[AN]
[FarLeft][3LB]
We should spare as many of them as we[N]
can, milady. The blame lies not with[N]
them for their lord's failures.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Agreed. Perhaps they'll even repay us[N]
for our good will[Beat] Regardless,[AN]
our task is clear:[A] cut through the town[N]
and take the outpost for ourselves.[AN]
Follow my lead![AN][X]


//End of convo; esme, solomin, alastore all move towards the town to deployment positions; cuts to the town; first, to the enemy leader with Osman; and then colson and Korina

## C5BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadOsman]
[MidRight][LoadLycus]
Sir! The preparations you recommended[N]
are complete. We're ready for them.[A]
[MidLeft]
Good. I must return to Duke Yulian's side,[N]
so the rest is up to you, Captain Lycus.[A]
[MidRight][1LB]
I won't fail you, Chancellor Osman.[A]
[MidLeft][3LB]
See to it that you don't. Otherwise[Beat][N]
I cannot guarantee you'll keep your[N]
position or your life. Keep this in mind.[AN][X]

//Osman leaves

## C5BeginningScene4
[MidRight][LoadLycus][3LB]
[Beat]He's even more unpleasant than usual,[N]
but orders are orders. Soldiers, to arms![N]
Don't let a single enemy pass you by,[AN]
even if it kills you. If any conscripts[N]
have cold feet, then remind them that[N]
retreat only leads to a different grave![AN][X]

//Pans to Korina (red) outside of his sister's cell

## C5BeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadKratos]
[MidRight][LoadKorina]
[MidLeft]
Please, Korina![N]
Don't go out there.[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't have a choice, Kratos.[N]
For your sake, I have to do this.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[MidRight][MoveLeft][ClearFace][Left][LoadKorina]
[MidRight][LoadSoldier][3LB]
That's right. If you want to see your[N]
brother safe again, you'll follow[N]
Captain Lycus's orders, sellsword.[A]
[Left][1LB]
Fine. I'll do as you say, for now[Beat][A][X]

//Korina leaves

## C5BeginningScene6
[MidRight][LoadKorina]
Dastard[Beat] The moment he's free,[N]
I'll turn my sword on Lycus next.[A][X]

//Pan to Colson and some greens

## C5BeginningScene7
[FarLeft][LoadLumberjack1]
[Left][LoadLumberjack2]
[MidRight][LoadColson]
[FarLeft][3LB]
Ya sure about this, Colson? Those[N]
soldiers are after us now. Maybe[N]
we should just go along with 'em.[A]
[MidRight]
No. If we fall in with the soldiers,[N]
y'all ain't goin' anywhere except[N]
right into House Luiza's blades.[A]
[Left]
And we ain't gonna eat dirt fighting off[N]
the soldiers instead? I don't wanna[N]
die, boss, but I can't see a way out![A]
[MidRight]
Easy, Cid. We'll fight 'em off til the[N]
Luiza army comes our way and bails us[N]
out. If they don't make it in time[Beat][AN]
Then it was nice knowin' ya, fellas.[A][X]

//End of start event


//End event
## C5EndingScene1
[FarLeft][LoadAlastore]
[Left][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight][LoadEsme][3LB]
Good work, everyone. We've conquered[N]
our first obstacle in ending Luiza's[N]
aggression, but more are yet to come.[AN]
[FarLeft][2LB]
True, but it makes victory no less sweet.[N]
Your leadership proved essential, Lady Esme.[AN]
[MidRight]
As did your valor and soldiers,[N]
Lord Alastore. We make a good team.[A]
[Left]
It wouldn't be a conversation between[N]
nobles without needless compliments[Beat][AN]
Hold a moment. We've got a lone traveler[N]
coming from the way we came in to town.[AN]
[MidRight][1LB]
Just one? Odd timing[Beat] who are they?[A]
[Left][2LB]
Only one way to find out, eh?[N]
Let's greet our uninvited guest.[A][X]

//The group goes back to the gate; meets Jerolde ? (Oldest son of Duke Yulian)

[Right][LoadFaceFancy][0x2][0x1][0x80][0x01][0x02][0x01][0x01][0xD]
[MidRight][LoadAlastore][FarRight][LoadSolomin]
[Right]
Hm? Wait[Beat] Jerolde, is that you?[N]
What are you doing here?[A]
[FarLeft][3LB]
It's been a long time, Esme. I see the[N]
tales of your courage are true. I made[N]
the right choice in finding you, friend.[A]
[FarRight][2LB]
Why's the son of Duke Yulian thanking us[N]
when we've just taken some of his land?[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
True, that is odd[Beat] but even moreso,[N]
what happened to you, Lord Jerolde?[N]
Your armor looks ready to fall apart.[A]
[FarLeft]
Ah, you all don't know. My father[Beat][N]
is no longer with us. I've been on the[N]
run ever since I heard of his death.[A]
[Right][1LB]
What?! Then who's leading House Yulian?[A]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Armel, the cur. While I visited nearby[N]
allies, a coup claimed my father's life.[AN]
My traitorous younger brother strode in[N]
and claimed the throne in my absence.[AN]
[Right]
That's[Beat] I'm very sorry to hear that.[N]
Duke Yulian deserved better than this.[A]
[FarRight][3LB]
Well, it explains why House Yulian's[N]
actions seemed strange. The foolish[N]
younger son doesn't know what he's doing.[AN]
[FarLeft]
He's done his best to have me killed,[N]
but no luck so far. Still, his efforts,[N]
along with this hostile new world,[AN]
have taken a toll. I can barely stand,[N]
let alone fight beside your band.[A]
[MidRight]
It is a true shame that you cannot.[N]
We would have been well served[N]
with the duke's son at our side.[AN]
[Right]
Are you certain Armel orchestrated this?[N]
Pardon me, but it is difficult to imagine[N]
that the boy possesses a shred of cunning.[A]
[FarLeft][2LB]
It's true that he's not the sharpest.[N]
Still, if not him, then who else?[A]
[Right]
A puppeteer who pulls his strings,[N]
perhaps[Beat] Well, it matters not.[AN]
I pledge to unseat him and put[N]
the rightful heir on the throne.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Thank you, Esme.[N]
I am forever in your debt.[A]
[Right]
We can talk about repayment later.[N]
For now, let us continue our march.[A]
[FarLeft]
Right. Lord Alastore, if you could fill[N]
me in on the situation, I'd appreciate it.[A]
[MidRight][1LB]
Of course. Where to begin[Beat][A][X]

//The two walk off, leaving solomin and esme alone

## C5EndingScene3
[MidLeft][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight][LoadEsme][3LB]
Jerolde's return is a stroke of good[N]
luck, eh? If we return his throne[N]
to him, our future will be bright.[AN]
Perhaps we'll even be able to bring[N]
House Yulian under our banner[Beat][N]
What do you think, Solomin?[A]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Who knows? An old friend he may be,[N]
but he's may not be eager to cooperate.[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
Perhaps not, but House Yulian's debt[N]
only grows. His honor will demand[N]
that he repay us by the conflict's end.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If that's how you'd speak of a friend[N]
who owes you one, I'd hate to see[N]
what you have planned for Alastore.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Is it wrong to expect that one who[N]
requires aid should return the favor?[AN]
Past Luiza heirs played the selfless[N]
act at the expense of our house,[AN]
but I will not make the same[N]
mistakes as my forebearers.[A]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Take care not to make new ones either.[N]
Thinking of everyone in terms of[N]
what you'll gain from them[Beat][AN]
going down that path will leave you[N]
with no true allies in the end, Esme.[A]
[MidRight]
I'll keep that in mind, Solomin[Beat][N]
We've spent enough time talking.[N]
Let's catch up to the others.[A][X]
