// NOTES
// I'm assuming, for no reason, that Neritas from ch 2 is the leader of the Tsezaran soldiers. If they're not, then you can sub out any Neritas dialogue with whomever that character is, and I can adjust the tone of their dialogue to be more in line with how they're written in ch 2.

[MidLeft][LoadNeritas]
[Right][LoadEsme]
[FarRight][LoadSolomin]
[Right]
Goodness,[.4] these cliffs are steep.[.5N]
Are we sure this is the right way?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
We spent weeks trying to chart[N]
this region,[.4] to see if we could[N]
secure a path beyond the canyon.[AN]
This was the only path we found;[.5N]
there is no wrong way to go.[AN]
[Right]
Fair enough.[.5] To think,[.4N]
only a short while ago,[.4N]
none of this was even here[Beat][AN]
it boggles the mind.[A]
[FarRight]
You should see what's happened[N]
to the rest of Luizan territory.[AN]
On our expeditions,[.4] we found[N]
entire mountains sunk beneath the earth,[.4N]
trees that coil like snakes,[AN]
vast arches of ice that look[N]
as though they crystallized mid-flow.[.5N]
It's truly another world out there[Beat][AN]
[Right]
[Beat] Indeed[Beat] Say,[.4] Neritas,[.4N]
you've still yet to tell us[N]
what threat has you so concerned.[AN]
Is it the beasts?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Beasts?[.5] No, not at all.[.5] They tend[N]
to stay away from our territory;[.5N]
I suspect the cliffs help in that regard.[AN]
No, it's mere men that plague our lands.[AN]
[Right][1LB]
Men?[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Aye, those of House Yulian.[AN]
Ours is the latest in a string[N]
of conquests since the Star fell.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hah![.5] Typical.[.5] It's the end of the world,[.4N]
and still the nobles quarrel.[AN]
I suppose it's all the same if[N]
their people die by blade or claw,[.4] no?[AN]
[Right][3LB]
House Yulian[Beat] how odd.[.5] Duke Yulian[N]
has always been a reasonable man[N]
in the time I've known him.[AN]
Is his lot truly so desparate that[N]
he must resort to this barbarism?[AN]
[FarRight][2LB]
They don't make thrones[N]
for reasonable men,[.4] Esme.[AN]
[Right]
Oh?[.5] And what of my father?[AN]
Does this opinion of yours[N]
extend to mine own family as well?[AN]
[FarRight]
Push him hard enough,[.4N]
and he's like to do the same.[AN]
From atop that lofty chair,[.4N]
all others look mighty small.[AN]
[Right][1LB]
Hmph.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
There,[.4] around that bend[N]
and we'll be just about through.[AN]
[Right]
Finally![.5] I never thought I'd[N]
be one to be afraid of heights,[AN]
but these cliffs are wont[N]
to instill that fear in anybody![AN][X]

## Chapter3BeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadNeritas]
[Right][LoadEsme]
[FarRight][LoadSolomin]
[MidLeft]
My god,[.4] do you see that?[.5N]
On the horizon![AN]
[Right]
Smoke[Beat][N]
What lies in that direction?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat]![.5] The Duke![.5N]
That's the seat of power![AN]
I don't believe it;[.5N]
they're already attacking![AN]
[FarRight]
Then there's no time to waste.[.5N]
Esme?[A]
[Right]
Indeed.[.5] Everyone,[.4] pick up the pace![.5N]
Looks like we've got a city to save![AN][X]

## Chapter3BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadNeil]
[MidRight][LoadAlastore]
[MidRight]
Do you hear that,[.4] Sir Neil?[.5N]
The sound of many horses[Beat][AN]
Could Neritas have finally returned,[.4N]
with other Tsezari patriots in tow?[AN]
[MidLeft]
They could just as easily be[N]
enemy reinforcements,[.4] milord.[AN]
Cowardly ones,[.4] without a banner,[.4N]
but Yulians are hardly lion-hearted.[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
If so,[.4] the rest of our uninvited[N]
guests would surely step well aside[N]
to let these new arrivals through[Beat][AN]
And yet,[.4] they only seem more tense.[AN]
Sir Neil,[.4] I believe we shall take[N]
our chances.[.5] Guard the rear entrance,[.4N]
and I will join our magi to the south.[AN]
[MidLeft]
But,[.4] milord,[.4] you're too vital to take[N]
to the field and risk your life![AN]
Please,[.4] reconsider-[AN]
[MidRight]
I have considered it more than enough.[.5N]
The guardsmen at each gate can barely[N]
stand.[.5] If we leave them as they are,[AN]
there will be no Castle Tsezar for[N]
our would-be saviors to liberate.[.5N]
Besides,[.4] you have naught to fear.[AN]
The fire magi of House Yulian cluster[N]
to the south,[.4] and not one of them[N]
can hold a candle to my might![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It's talk like that which makes[N]
me worry,[.4] but if you insist,[.4] milord,[.4N]
I'll hold the north gate at all costs![AN]
[MidRight]
Excellent![.5] Cornered we may be,[.4N]
but what better time to bare our fangs?[.5N]
All troops,[.4] hold firm and make them bleed![A][X]

## Chapter3BartsIntroduction
[MidRight][LoadBarts][3LB]
Hmph[Beat] So they haven't given up yet.[AN]
That northern force is worrisome,[.4N]
but we have numbers and superior[N]
tactics over these Tsezari dogs.[AN]
All these men,[.4] and [Red]there are[N]
even more hiding in the Tsezari[N]
forts[Red] we captured during our siege.[AN]
My long-deserved promotion is nearly[N]
at hand.[.5] [OpenQuote]Captain Barts"[Beat][N]
I can nearly taste the glory.[AN]
All I have to do now is carry out[N]
one last task,[.4] and my name will go[N]
down in the history of House Yulia![A][X]

## Chapter3Reinforcement1Text
[FarLeft][LoadSoldier]
[Left][LoadSoldier]
[MidRight][LoadBarts]
[FarLeft][1LB]
Reporting for duty,[.4] boss![A]
[Left]
We're ready for anything![A]
[MidRight][2LB]
[Beat] Hold on.[.5] Who are you?[.5N]
What are you doing here?[A]
[Left]
Huh?[.5] You told us to come[N]
and attack the gate,[.4] right?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
The OTHER gate,[.4] you buffoons![AN]
What are two heavily armored[N]
soldiers supposed to accomplish,[.4N]
fighting against thunder mages?[AN]
[FarLeft][1LB]
Er[Beat] Hitting them real hard?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Ugh,[.4] forget it.[.5] Well,[.4] since you're[N]
already here,[.4] go ahead and charge.[.5N]
Maybe you'll take the keep after all.[AN]
[Left][2LB]
Y-Yes,[.4] sir![.5N]
We'll leave immediately![A]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][3LB]
Idiots![.5] Well,[.4] there go my plans.[AN]
I'll have to ensure the next wave[N]
fight under ideal conditions,[.4N]
but this one can buy me some time.[AN]
Their sacrifice will not[Beat][N]
Well,[.4] it likely will be forgotten.[A][X]

## Chapter3Reinforcement2Text
[MidRight][LoadBarts][3LB]
They still haven't given up?[AN]
How infuriating[Beat][N]
Those enemies from the northern[N]
pass ruined all of my strategies![AN]
If this continues,[.4] I may[N]
have to take to the field[N]
and play the last card I have[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter3Reinforcement3Text
[MidRight][LoadBarts][3LB]
This[Beat] This is madness![AN]
House Yulian gave me more than enough[N]
soldiers for this siege,[.4] and now,[.4N]
we risk losing to Tsezari rabble?[AN]
If I'm to have my glory,[.4] then[Beat][N]
I'll have to seize it myself![AN]
The rest of you,[.4] earn your damn keep![.5N]
[Red]Charge until you fall dead![Red][.5N]
Death or glory awaits us all![AN][X]

## Chapter3EsmeAlastoreTalkText
[MidLeft][LoadAlastore]
[MidRight][LoadEsme]
[MidRight]
Ah,[.4] Duke Alastore![.5] It's a relief[N]
to see that you still stand.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
I owe much of that to your band.[AN]
I am not without gratitude for your[N]
timely assistance,[.4] but might I ask,[.4N]
who are you,[.4] and why do you aid us?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Ah,[.4] so you don't remember me?[AN]
I suppose it's been some time[N]
since we last met.[.5] Well[Beat][AN]
Let's save further introductions[N]
for a more appropriate setting.[AN]
Preferably,[.4] with less arrows[N]
pointed at our heads,[.4] hm?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Ha![.5] Fair enough,[.4] my lady.[.5N]
If we target their commander,[.4N]
the rest will flee soon enough.[AN]
He seems an inferior fire mage[Beat][N]
If I attack first,[.4] his defenses[N]
will falter easily.[.5] What say you?[N]
[MidRight][2LB]
No objections here,[.4] milord.[.5N]
Please,[.4] after you![A][X]

## Chapter3NeritasNeilTalkText
[MidLeft][LoadNeil]
[MidRight][LoadNeritas]
Sir Neil![.5] I've returned,[.4N]
and with friends in tow![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
That I can see,[.4] Neritas.[.5N]
Good work,[.4] but most of these[N]
soldiers aren't Tsezari,[.4] eh?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes,[.4] unfortunately.[.5] I rallied[N]
a good number of troops,[.4] but[Beat][N]
The beasts took far too many.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] A damn shame.[.5] Still,[.4N]
you did the best you could.[AN]
If these people you found stick[N]
around,[.4] they'll be vital to our[N]
attempts to beat back the Yulians.[AN]
Carry yourself with pride,[.4] Neritas,[.4N]
and fight on for those we've lost.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I'll do just that,[.4] sir[Beat][N]
For all of the fallen,[.4] I must.[A][X]

## Chapter3EndingSceneNeilAlive
[FarLeft][LoadNeil]
[Left][LoadAlastore]
[Right][LoadEsme]
[FarRight][LoadSolomin]
[FarLeft]
Esme Luiza,[.4] may I introduce[N]
you to Duke Alastore Tsezar?[AN]

[Left]
Ah,[.4] the young Lady Luiza![AN]
I admit,[.4] it was quite the shock[N]
to see Luizan colours in our territory.[AN]

[Right]
I presume you felt much the same[N]
during Yulian's incursions,[.4] no?[AN]
Hah,[.4] regardless,[.4] a pleasure to see[N]
you again,[.4] despite the circumstances.[AN]

[Left]
Indeed.[.5] Though I wish could provide[N]
some more,[.4] ah,[.4] suitable amenities,[AN]
I confess that your arrival[N]
could not have been more timely.[AN]
We owe you a great debt.[AN]

[Right]
Come now, milord![.5] This is no time[N]
to be speaking of debts to repay![AN]
We should be speaking[N]
of grand reunions,[.4] no?[AN]

[Left]
Hah,[.4] perhaps we should![.5] Though,[.4N]
I must ask;[.5] what brings you[N]
to my hold,[.4] now of all times?[AN]
And with such strange company in tow![AN]

[Right]
Ah,[.4] you must be referring[N]
to my associate,[.4] here?[AN]

[FarRight]
[OpenQuote]Associate?"[.5] How formal of you,[.4N]
[OpenQuote]Lady Luiza."[AN]

[Left][3LB]
Hm.[.5] He could do with some manners,[.4N]
but he fought with all the[N]
valour of a trained knight.[AN]
You pick your underlings well.[AN]

[FarRight][1LB]
Underling is even worse[Beat][AN]

[Right][2LB]
Oh,[.4] calm yourself,[.4] Solomin,[.4N]
he's only teasing.[.5] Right,[.4] milord?[AN]

[Left]
Yes,[.4] yes,[.4N]
it was a mere jest.[AN]

[FarRight]
Hmph.[.5] We're wasting time on pleasantries[N]
while your hold teeters on the brink,[AN]
[OpenQuote]milord."[.5] Perhaps if you wasted less time,[.4N]
you wouldn't need Esme to bail you out.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Hold your tongue![.5N]
You speak to the Duke himself![AN]

[Right]
Now,[.4] now,[.4] Solomin,[.4] let's be courteous.[.5N]
We are guests here,[.4] are we not,[.4] Duke?[AN]

[Left][3LB]
Guests,[.4] yes,[.4] but heroes as well.[.5N]
Your friend is,[.4] regrettably,[.4] correct;[.5N]
we've little time to spare,[.4] I fear.[AN]
House Yulian could already be[N]
preparing for their next assault.[AN]

[Right]
And what preparations do you plan[N]
to make,[.4] milord?[A] I assume you've[N]
already placed a weapon in the[N]
hands of every capable man in town.[AN]
You wouldn't presume to arm their[N]
wives and children next,[.4] would you?[AN]

[Left][1LB]
Of course not![AN]

[FarRight][2LB]
Sounds to me like you need some help[N]
from without.[.5] What do you think,[.4] Esme?[A]

[Right][3LB]
Hah,[.4] yes,[.4] I would think the Duke would[N]
be most grateful were we to extend[N]
a helping hand at this juncture.[AN]
Am I wrong?[AN]

[Left]
[Beat] To be frank,[.4] Lady Luiza,[.4N]
I'm not in a position to be[N]
turning down your assistance.[AN]
But this song and dance you're playing[Beat][N]
you want something in return.[AN]

[Right]
You truly think so little of me?[AN]
The threat that House Yulian[N]
poses looms over us all,[.4N]
Tsezari and Luizan both.[AN]
I believe we should join hands,[.4N]
under one banner,[.4] and bring the[N]
fight to our shared enemy together.[AN]

[Left][1LB]
One banner,[.4] but in which colours?[AN]

[Right][3LB]
Well,[.4] it is my army,[.4] so naturally,[.4N]
those of House Luiza.[.5N]
Unless you have some objection?[AN]

[Left][1LB]
[Beat][AN]

[FarRight][3LB]
Unless something changes,[.4] your house[N]
is gonna be wiped out.[.5] You can't[N]
even defend your own capital;[AN]
how could you ever hope to protect[N]
your hold?[.5] Or does the safety of[N]
your people mean nothing to you?[AN]

[Left][2LB]
Yes[Beat] yes,[.4] I suppose you are right.[.5N]
It is as you say;[.5] something must change.[AN]
Lady Luiza,[.4] we of House Tsezar humbly[N]
accept your offer of assistance,[AN]
on the condition that I be[N]
allowed to fight alongside you.[AN]

[FarLeft][1LB]
S-sir?[AN]

[Right]
Oh?[.5] Are you sure that's wise,[.4] milord?[A]

[Left][2LB]
My people deserve a leader[N]
who will fight for them.[AN]
If you aim to reverse our fortunes,[.4N]
I would stand on the frontlines with you.[AN]

[FarLeft]
You couldn't possibly,[.4] milord![.5N]
It's too dangerous![AN]

[Left][3LB]
Silence,[.4] Neritas.[.5N]
I have made my choice.[.5N]
What say you,[.4] Esme?[AN]

[Right]
If you wish to join your power[N]
to ours,[.4] you have every right[N]
to be among the forces granted.[AN]
I wouldn't dream of turning down[N]
the chance to fight alongside[N]
a Duke of the Hederan league![AN]
Shall we make the necessary preparations?[AN]

[Left][1LB]
Yes,[.4] let's.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
Milord,[.4] are you sure this is wise?[AN]

[Left]
[Beat][AN]

[FarLeft]
Milord?[.5] You seem troubled.[AN]

[Left][3LB]
Though the words were not spoken,[.4N]
I fear I may have just signed away[N]
our sovereignty to that woman[Beat][AN]

[FarLeft][1LB]
M-milord?[AN]

[Left][3LB]
Hmph.[.5] Pay me no heed,[.4] Neritas.[AN]
'Tis not the lot of knights[N]
to worry on the affairs of lords.[.5N]
Now,[.4] come;[.5] we've a war to win,[.4] do we not?[AN]

[FarLeft][1LB]
I-I[Beat] of course,[.4] milord![AN][X]
