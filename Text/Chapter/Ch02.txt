It looks like this house[N]
hasn't been ransacked yet[Beat][AN]
No survivors here, though.[AN]
[Beat]Is that some kind of staff?[N]
I guess I should take it with me.[A][X]

## C2NeritasText
Neritas is a [Red]Game Over[Red][N]
unit for this chapter.[N]
Protect them and defeat all[N]
enemies to clear this map.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme][OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin]
[OpenMidLeft]
The village is coming into view, Solomin.[N]
[Beat]It looks as dire as the others.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]We should investigate.[N]
There may be survivors.[AN]
Be on your guard.[N]
I'll ride ahead to scout.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat][N]
What has become of my home?[AN][OpenEyes]
No time for such talk, Esme.[N]
You've been through worse.[AN]
Challenges are opportunities by[N]
another time, are they not?[AN]
Surely, we will find others and get[N]
to the bottom of this mess.[AN]
Yes, that sounds like a much more[N]
palatable outcome.[A]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Lady Esme![N]
There are survivors.[AN]
Let's ride![A]
[FarLeft]
Very well. Let us ride![A][X]

[Left]
Ondrej, how is it outside?[A]
[Right]
It's crawling with those[Beat][N]
those things![AN]
They look like regular folk,[N]
but they don't act like 'em.[A]
[FarLeft]
We've been holed up here for[N]
over four days.[AN]
We've already gone through the smoked[N]
trout, and all that's left is stale bread.[AN]
We have enough water for maybe[N]
twelve more hours.[A]
[Left]
What are you saying then?[A]
[FarLeft]
We're doomed.[AN]
That is, doomed to face our fate[N]
unless we act.[A]
[Right]
Easy for you to say, Vulture.[AN]
Neritas and I can cross blades with[N]
these bizarre beasts.[AN]
You tell us how many minutes we[N]
have until we starve![A]
[Left]
Ondrej! There is no need for that.[N]
We must stick together.[AN]
Vulture, you know how to heal, right?[A]
[FarLeft]
It's one of my hobbies, yes.[A]
[Right]
Well, it's going to need to become[N]
more than a pastime.[AN]
The only way out of this is[N]
through them.[AN]
I'd rather die fighting than wither[N]
here like a grape in summertime.[A]
[Left]
Yes, we need to get to the Duke.[N]
He may take us in.[A]
[FarLeft]
Hm? Do you hear that?[AN]
It sounds like horses[Beat] many horses.[A]
[Right]
Perhaps the Duke is here to save us?[N]
Good fortune may be smiling on us.[A]
[Left]
Then let us not reject its kindness.[AN]
Ondrej, you and I take the point.[N]
Vulture, make sure we don't die.[AN]
Come on, let's go.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadSolomin]
[Right][3LB]
Well, where are these survivors,[N]
Solomin?[A] All I see are ashes[N]
and beasts in the form of men.[AN]
[FarRight]
They were holed up in that house[N]
in the far reaches[Beat] but it[N]
looks like they heard us coming.[AN]
[Right]
They're certainly no civilians[Beat][N]
Well, their identity can wait.[N]
Let's give them a helping hand![A][X]

Looks like the perimeter's clear.[N]
We should be safe to rest, for now.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Right[Beat] We should go look for[N]
their leader and inform them.[AN]
Neritas, I believe. They headed[N]
for that north house after the battle.[A]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Mm. They seem like the leader[N]
of those Tsezar soldiers.[AN]
Tread carefully with that one.[AN]
The duke'll hear every word you speak.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
You're too paranoid, Solomin[Beat][N]
Let's ascertain the situation[N]
and see how Duke Tsezar fares.[A][X]

Ah, if it isn't our saviors![AN]
We are grateful for your help.[N]
You arrived at the perfect time.[A]
[Left]
I'm glad it worked out.[AN]
Tell me, were there any other survivors?[A]
[FarRight]
Very few besides us.[N]
Only the villagers you see here.[AN]
Vulture is tending to them.[A]
[FarLeft]
These beasts have done a number[N]
on this place.[AN]
Where is the Duke?[A]
[Right]
Our plan was to rendezvous with him.[N]
Given the dire straits we're in,[AN]
we wanted to band together to get[N]
strength in numbers.[AN]
We stopped here a few days ago,[N]
but were quickly trapped by those things.[A]
[FarRight]
When we heard you arrive,[N]
we thought it was the Duke's men.[AN]
We certainly didn't expect House Luiza[N]
to come to our aid.[AN]
[Beat] Not to say we aren't grateful, of course.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] [A]
[Left]
[Beat] You said you were to visit the Duke?[N]
So, he still lives, to your knowledge?[A]
[Right]
That's right.[AN]
The Duke put out a call to all able-bodied[N]
people in his domain to come to his manse.[AN]
He intends to rebuild his strength.[A]
[FarRight]
The soldiers who informed us were killed.[N]
We were ambushed a week ago.[AN]
There were over a dozen of us[N]
when we got together.[AN][CloseEyes]
Malachy, Zorba, Girgensons,[N]
Greenwald, Longjian, Volos[Beat][AN]
[Beat] Too many to name.[A][OpenEyes]
[Right]
We'd only known each other for a few days,[N]
but the shared trauma of this[Beat][AN]
it brought us close.[AN]
All of them, taken too soon.[A]
[Left]
I am deeply sorry for your losses.[AN]
You still intend to go see the[N]
Duke though, correct?[AN]
Perhaps we can be your escort.[A]
[Right]
[Beat] We know the way.[A]
[Left]
Then it is settled.[N]
We'll travel together to the Duke.[A]
[FarLeft]
Take only what's needed.[N]
Discard the rest.[A]
[Left]
You both look famished.[AN]
Solomin, make sure these three get[N]
a proper meal.[AN]
Solomin caught a quail earlier.[N]
I trust this is acceptable?[AN]
[FarRight][CloseEyes]
Truly[Beat] we've been saved.[N]
Thank you, Lady Esme.[A][X]
