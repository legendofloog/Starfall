Argh![MoveMidRight] What are you laggards doing?[NL]
Go on, start attacking them![A]
[X]

## Ch1StartEvent
[OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[OpenMidRight]This is as far as the maps go,[NL]
Esme.[A] From here on out, we're in[NL]
uncharted territory.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's Lady Luiza to you, Solomin.[AN]
...Then I suppose we're on our own[NL]
from here on out.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Having second thoughts?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course not. I'm simply steeling[NL]
myself for what lies ahead.[AN]
Our mission is too important to be[NL]
jeopardized by mere uncertainty.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Heh, but you ARE uncertain.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Only insofar as we all are.[A] We're woefully[NL]
misinformed about what's out there...[AN]
But we need to re-establish contact with[NL]
the other Houses.[A] And it has to be us.[AN]
If we hesitate, and another House takes[NL]
the reins...[A] then House Luiza will never[NL]
reverse our fortunes.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOldrik]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, indeed, dear cousin![AN]
They will tell stories of the exploits of[NL]
Oldrik and Esme for generations to come![AN]
[ToggleSmile]Or perhaps...[....] just of Oldrik?[A][ToggleSmile][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]You have to have exploits for people[NL]
to tell tales of them, you know.[AN]
Maybe you should focus on that, first?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, your words would wound me so,[NL]
if you only had some venom to your bite![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBaeric][OpenLeft][LoadBasren]
[OpenFarLeft]Pipe down, you blowhard.[AN]
Lady Luiza has better things to do[NL]
than to indulge your fantasies.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Fantasies? Quite the bold rebuke[NL]
coming from a subordinate![AN]
[OpenLeft]We're all subordinates, Oldrik.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A preposterous notion. We're[NL]
here to prove ourselves![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Ridiculous...[AN]
[OpenLeft]Is this really what the nobility[NL]
are concerned about,[A] with the way[NL]
things are now?[A] Your pride?[AN]
I'm only here to put food on[NL]
the table back home...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]A far more noble and righteous[NL]
pursuit, I'd wager.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Wha-! But-![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Enough flapping your jaws![NL]
We've got places to be![AN]
[OpenLeft]Aye, Solomin![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]The nerve![A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent2

[OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[OpenMidRight]Hold, Esme. I don't like this.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Nor do I. Highwaymen,[NL]
do you suppose?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, but...[....] look closely at him.[A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent3

[OpenFarRight][LoadSolomin][OpenRight][LoadEsme][OpenMidLeft][LoadStarborn]
[OpenRight]You there![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Y...[....] Y...[....] You...[....] th...[....] there...[AN]
[OpenRight]Yes, you! What's happened to you?[AN]
What's your name?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What's...[....] your...[....] name...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]C'mon, lady, there's obviously[NL]
something wrong-[AN]
[OpenRight]You want to know MY name?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My name...[....] my name...?[AN]
Rrgh...![AN]
[OpenFarRight]Esme, look out![A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent4

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme][OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin]
[OpenMidLeft]N-Nice shot, Solomin.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're lucky he didn't tear[NL]
your damned head off.[AN]
But damn, what was that?[AN]
Some kind of magic?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hold that thought, Solomin.[AN]
Looks like our little display[NL]
caught some attention.[A][X]

## Ch1BossText

[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarbornBoss]
[OpenMidLeft]Grrrgh...[A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent5

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme][OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe skip the pleasantries[NL]
this time?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Not to worry, Solomin.[A] I don't[NL]
make the same mistakes twice.[AN]
To arms, everyone![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOldrik][OpenFarLeft][LoadBaeric][OpenLeft][LoadBasren]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, to arms, everyone![AN]
Simply follow my lead,[NL]
and the day will be ours![AN]
[OpenLeft]What strange, grotesque creatures...[AN]
Oh, I wish I had stayed home...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Just keep your head[NL]
on straight, pal.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[OpenMidLeft]Our first battle...[A] Ahem.[AN]
Let us begin![A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme][OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin]
[OpenMidRight]That looks to be the[NL]
last of them.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...[....] thank goodness...[AN]
Sheathe your blades, everyone.[AN]
The day is won.[A][X]

## Ch1OldrikEndQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOldrik]
[OpenMidLeft]Huzzah! You were all watching, yes?[AN]
The first of many victories under[NL]
my belt, I'm sure.[A][X]

## Ch1BasrenEndQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBasren]
[OpenMidLeft]I was worried we weren't going to[NL]
make it...[A] Thank goodness we did![A][X]

## Ch1BaericEndQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBaeric]
[OpenMidLeft]Could have been much worse...[AN]
but we had training, and luck,[NL]
on our side.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme][OpenMidRight][LoadSolomin]
[OpenMidLeft]I have to wonder...[....][NL]
what were these things?[AN]
They certainly weren't human.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We fought all manner of deformed[NL]
beast back home,[A] while we worked to[NL]
reclaim the Luizan border.[AN]
Perhaps these are much the same.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Men, deformed in the manner of beasts...[AN]
How disturbing.[A] Is this truly what[NL]
awaits us in this new world?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you want to turn back?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I just...[....] I can't believe so much[NL]
has changed in so little time...[A][X]

## Ch1EndingNarration

My name is Esme Luiza, heir to[NL]
the throne of House Luiza of[NL]
the Hederan League.[A] Six weeks ago,[NL]
the Star fell from the sky.[AN]
The mountains sank beneath the[NL]
earth, mighty chasms snake through[NL]
the land like malignant fingers,[AN]
oceans appeared where a city once[NL]
stood, and civilization as we[NL]
knew it vanished overnight.[AN]
For those of us who survived,[NL]
this was only the beginning;[AN]
great beasts roam the land,[NL]
attacking any wayward soul they meet.[AN]
Entire towns were slaughtered,[NL]
or turned to banditry.[AN]
The roads that once connected the[NL]
Houses are shattered and useless.[AN]
And yet still, we rebuilt.[AN]
Now, with the worst of the calamity[NL]
behind us, we look to the future;[AN]
we will not only reconnect with the[NL]
other houses, but unite them under[NL]
a single banner.[AN]
Our banner.[AN]
And it begins here.[A][X]
