Luiza Outskirts[X]

## Ch1StartEvent1_1
[MidLeft][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight][LoadEsme]
[MidLeft]
This is as far as the maps go,[NL]
Esme.[A] From here on out, we're in[NL]
uncharted territory.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's Lady Luiza to you, Solomin.[AN]
[Beat]Then I suppose we're on our own[NL]
from here on out.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Having second thoughts?[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course not. I'm simply steeling[NL]
myself for what lies ahead.[AN]
Our mission is too important to be[NL]
jeopardized by mere uncertainty.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh, but you ARE uncertain.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Only insofar as we all are.[A] We're woefully[NL]
misinformed about what's out there[Beat][AN]
But we need to re-establish contact with[NL]
the other Houses.[A] And it has to be us.[AN]
If we hesitate, and another House takes[NL]
the reins[Beat][A] then House Luiza will never[NL]
reverse our fortunes.[AN][X]

## Ch1StartEvent1_2
[MidLeft][LoadOldrik]
[MidRight][LoadEsme]
[MidLeft]
Oh, indeed, dear cousin![AN]
They will tell stories of the exploits of[NL]
Oldrik and Esme for generations to come![AN]
[ToggleSmile]Or perhaps[Beat] just of Oldrik?[A][ToggleSmile][NL]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
You have to have exploits for people[NL]
to tell tales of them, you know.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Maybe you should focus on that, first?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, your words would wound me so,[NL]
if you only had some venom to your bite![AN][X]

## Ch1StartEvent1_3
[FarLeft][LoadBaeric][Left][LoadBasren][MidRight][LoadOldrik]
[FarLeft]
Pipe down, you blowhard.[AN]
Lady Luiza has better things to do[NL]
than to indulge your fantasies.[AN]
[MidRight]
Fantasies? Quite the bold rebuke[NL]
coming from a subordinate![AN]
[Left]
We're all subordinates, Oldrik.[AN]
[MidRight]
A preposterous notion. We're[NL]
here to prove ourselves![AN]
[FarLeft]
Ridiculous[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Is this really what the nobility[NL]
are concerned about,[A] with the way[NL]
things are now?[A] Your pride?[AN]
I'm only here to put food on[NL]
the table back home[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft]
A far more noble and righteous[NL]
pursuit, I'd wager.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wha-! But-![AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Enough flapping your jaws![NL]
We've got places to be![AN]
[Left]
Aye, Solomin![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
The nerve![A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent2

[MidRight][LoadSolomin][MidLeft][LoadEsme]
[MidRight]
Hold, Esme. I don't like this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Nor do I. Highwaymen,[NL]
do you suppose?[AN]
[MidRight]
No, but[Beat] look closely at him.[A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent3

[FarLeft][LoadSolomin][Left][LoadEsme][MidRight][LoadStarborn]
[Left]
You there![AN]
[MidRight]
Y[Beat] Y[Beat] You[Beat] th[Beat] there[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Yes, you! What's happened to you?[AN]
What's your name?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's[Beat] your[Beat] name[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft]
C'mon, lady, there's obviously[NL]
something wrong-[AN]
[Left]
You want to know MY name?[AN]
[MidRight]
My name[Beat] my name[Beat]?[AN]
Rrgh[Beat]![AN]
[FarLeft]
Esme, look out![A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent4

[MidRight][LoadEsme][MidLeft][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight]
N-Nice shot, Solomin.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're lucky he didn't tear[NL]
your damned head off.[AN]
But damn, what was that?[AN]
Some kind of magic?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold that thought, Solomin.[AN]
Looks like our little display[NL]
caught some attention.[A][X]

## Ch1BossText
[MidRight][LoadStarbornBoss]
[MidRight]
Grrrgh[Beat][A][X]

## Ch1StartEvent5

[MidLeft][LoadEsme][MidRight][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight]
Maybe skip the pleasantries[NL]
this time?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not to worry, Solomin.[A] I don't[NL]
make the same mistakes twice.[AN]
To arms, everyone![AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadOldrik][OpenFarLeft][LoadBaeric][Left][LoadBasren]
[MidRight]
Yes, to arms, everyone![AN]
Simply follow my lead,[NL]
and the day will be ours![AN]
[Left]
What strange, grotesque creatures[Beat][AN]
Oh, I wish I had stayed home[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Just keep your head[NL]
on straight, pal.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadEsme]
[MidLeft]
Our first battle[Beat][A] Ahem.[AN]
Let us begin![A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene
[MidLeft][LoadEsme][MidRight][LoadSolomin]
[MidRight]
That looks to be the[NL]
last of them.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sigh[Beat] thank goodness[Beat][AN]
Sheathe your blades, everyone.[AN]
The day is won.[A][X]

## Ch1OldrikEndQuote
[MidLeft][LoadOldrik]
[MidLeft]
Huzzah! You were all watching, yes?[AN]
The first of many victories under[NL]
my belt, I'm sure.[A][X]

## Ch1BasrenEndQuote
[MidLeft][LoadBasren]
[MidLeft]
I was worried we weren't going to[NL]
make it[Beat][A] Thank goodness we did![A][X]

## Ch1BaericEndQuote
[MidLeft][LoadBaeric]
[MidLeft]
Could have been much worse[Beat][AN]
but we had training, and luck,[NL]
on our side.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene2
[MidLeft][LoadEsme][MidRight][LoadSolomin]
[MidLeft]
I have to wonder[Beat][NL]
what were these things?[AN]
They certainly weren't human.[AN]
[MidRight]
We fought all manner of deformed[NL]
beast back home,[A] while we worked to[NL]
reclaim the Luizan border.[AN]
Perhaps these are much the same.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Men, deformed in the manner of beasts[Beat][AN]
How disturbing.[A] Is this truly what[NL]
awaits us in this new world?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Do you want to turn back?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No. I just[Beat] I can't believe so much[NL]
has changed in so little time[Beat][A][X]

## Ch1EndingNarration

My name is Esme Luiza, heir to[NL]
the throne of House Luiza of[NL]
the Hederan League.[A] Six weeks ago,[NL]
the Star fell from the sky.[AN]
The mountains sank beneath the[NL]
earth, mighty chasms snake through[NL]
the land like malignant fingers,[AN]
oceans appeared where a city once[NL]
stood, and civilization as we[NL]
knew it vanished overnight.[AN]
For those of us who survived,[NL]
this was only the beginning;[AN]
great beasts roam the land,[NL]
attacking any wayward soul they meet.[AN]
Entire towns were slaughtered,[NL]
or turned to banditry.[AN]
The roads that once connected the[NL]
Houses are shattered and useless.[AN]
And yet still, we rebuilt.[AN]
Now, with the worst of the calamity[NL]
behind us, we look to the future;[AN]
we will not only reconnect with the[NL]
other houses, but unite them under[NL]
a single banner.[AN]
Our banner.[AN]
And it begins here.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadEsme]
[MidRight][LoadSolomin][1LB]
Esme, a word?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, Solomin?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
These things aren't like the beasts[N]
that we've seen in Luiza's borders.[AN]
They've got weapons, and I'd bet[N]
that they know how to use them.[AN]
If we want to make it out safely,[N]
we're going to need a strategy[N]
more involved than cutting them down.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
And what might that be?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Do you see that [Red]axeman[Red] over there?[N]
If you or I take a [Red]sword[Red] to him,[N]
he'll struggle to make a counterattack.[AN]
Even better, the blow will throw him off,[N]
leaving him [Red]wide open[Red] to another attack.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
I see[Beat] And an axe does the same[N]
to a lance, and a lance to a sword?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][3LB]
Heh, you catch on quick, lady.[AN]
Of course, you actually have to land[N]
the hit, and it has to leave a mark,[N]
but those are minor details, really.[AN]
More importantly, our enemies can do[N]
this too, so our positioning is key[N]
to make sure we can fight back.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][2LB]
Hm[Beat] Thank you for the information,[N]
Solomin. I'll put it to good use![AN][X]

## BreakTutorialText
Starfall uses the Break system instead[N]
of FE8's WTA bonuses. When a unit at[N]
advantage (e.g. Swords -> Axes) initiates[N]
and damages the enemy, they will be Broken.[AN]
This makes them unable to counterattack[N]
during the round, and they are unable to[N]
fight back for their next round of combat.[AN]
Broken units will regain their composure[N]
when they enter their own battle phase,[N]
allowing them to attack again.[A][X]
